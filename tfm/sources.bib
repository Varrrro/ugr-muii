	abstract = {As system integration becomes an increasingly important challenge for complex real-time systems, there has been a signiﬁcant demand for supporting real-time systems in virtualized environments. This paper presents RT-Xen, the ﬁrst real-time hypervisor scheduling framework for Xen, the most widely used open-source virtual machine monitor (VMM). RT-Xen bridges the gap between real-time scheduling theory and Xen, whose wide-spread adoption makes it an attractive platform for integrating a broad range of real-time and embedded systems. Moreover, RT-Xen provides an opensource platform for researchers and integrators to develop and evaluate real-time scheduling techniques, which to date have been studied predominantly via analysis and simulations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the feasibility, eﬃciency, and eﬃcacy of ﬁxed-priority hierarchical real-time scheduling in RT-Xen. RT-Xen instantiates a suite of ﬁxed-priority servers (Deferrable Server, Periodic Server, Polling Server, and Sporadic Server). While the server algorithms are not new, this empirical study represents the ﬁrst comprehensive experimental comparison of these algorithms within the same virtualization platform. Our empirical evaluation shows that RT-Xen can provide eﬀective real-time scheduling to guest Linux operating systems at a 1ms quantum, while incurring only moderate overhead for all the ﬁxed-priority server algorithms. While more complex algorithms such as Sporadic Server do incur higher overhead, none of the overhead diﬀerences among diﬀerent server algorithms are signiﬁcant. Deferrable Server generally delivers better soft real-time performance than the other server algorithms, while Periodic Server incurs high deadline miss ratios in overloaded situations.},

	abstract = {Numerous systems have been designed which use virtualization to subdivide the ample resources of a modern computer. Some require specialized hardware, or cannot support commodity operating systems. Some target 100\% binary compatibility at the expense of performance. Others sacrifice security or functionality for speed. Few offer resource isolation or performance guarantees; most provide only best-effort provisioning, risking denial of service.This paper presents Xen, an x86 virtual machine monitor which allows multiple commodity operating systems to share conventional hardware in a safe and resource managed fashion, but without sacrificing either performance or functionality. This is achieved by providing an idealized virtual machine abstraction to which operating systems such as Linux, BSD and Windows XP, can be ported with minimal effort.Our design is targeted at hosting up to 100 virtual machine instances simultaneously on a modern server. The virtualization approach taken by Xen is extremely efficient: we allow operating systems such as Linux and Windows XP to be hosted simultaneously for a negligible performance overhead --- at most a few percent compared with the unvirtualized case. We considerably outperform competing commercial and freely available solutions in a range of microbenchmarks and system-wide tests.},

	title = {Architectural styles and the design of network-based software architectures},
	abstract = {The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The Web has been iteratively developed over the past ten years through a series of modifications to the standards that define its architecture. In order to identify those aspects of the Web that needed improvement and avoid undesirable modifications, a model for the modern Web architecture was needed to guide its design, definition, and deployment. Software architecture research investigates methods for determining how best to partition a system, how components identify and communicate with each other, how information is communicated, how elements of a system can evolve independently, and how all of the above can be described using formal and informal notations. My work is motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software through principled use of architectural constraints, thereby obtaining the functional, performance, and social properties desired of an architecture. An architectural style is a named, coordinated set of architectural constraints. This dissertation defines a framework for understanding software architecture via architectural styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the architectural design of network-based application software. A survey of architectural styles for network-based applications is used to classify styles according to the architectural properties they induce on an architecture for distributed hypermedia. I then introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style and describe how REST has been used to guide the design and development of the architecture for the modern Web. REST emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. I describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. Finally, I describe the lessons learned from applying REST to the design of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifier standards, and from their subsequent deployment in Web client and server software.},

As for ICS, workload also can be distributed among sensors, actuators and network infrastructure facilities near the sources of data. The authors simulated typical workload distribution situations for the “traditional” ICS architecture and for the one with fogcomputing concept elements usage.

In this paper we extend the offset-based schedulability analysis techniques to systems with EDF scheduling, using analytical techniques that are similar to those developed for fixed priority scheduling. With this new analysis, we now have a complete set of techniques to perform the analysis of different task models in distributed heterogeneous systems, i.e., processors and communication networks having either fixed priority or EDF schedulers.},

	abstract = {Real-time scheduling is the theoretical basis of real-time systems engineering. Earliest deadline first (EDF) is an optimal scheduling algorithm for uniprocessor real-time systems. Existing results on an exact schedulability test for EDF task systems with arbitrary relative deadlines need to calculate the processor demand of the task set at every absolute deadline to check if there is an overflow in a specified time interval. The resulting large number of calculations severely restricts the use of EDF in practice. In this paper, we propose new results on necessary and sufficient schedulability analysis for EDF scheduling; the new results reduce, exponentially, the calculation times, in all situations, for schedulable task sets, and in most situations, for unschedulable task sets. For example, a 16-task system that in the previous analysis had to check 858,331 points (deadlines) can, with the new analysis, be checked at just 12 points. There are no restrictions on the new results: each task can be periodic or sporadic, with relative deadline, which can be less than, equal to, or greater than its period, and task parameters can range over many orders of magnitude.},

The vast majority of computers in use, however, are much less visible. They run the engine, brakes, seatbelts, airbag, and audio system in your car. They digitally encode your voice and construct a radio signal to send it from your cell phone to a base station. They command robots on a factory floor, power generation in a power plant, processes in a chemical plant, and traffic lights in a city. These less visible computers are called embedded systems, and the software they run is called embedded software. The principal challenges in designing and analyzing embedded systems stem from their interaction with physical processes. This book takes a cyber-physical approach to embedded systems, introducing the engineering concepts underlying embedded systems as a technology and as a subject of study. The focus is on modeling, design, and analysis of cyber-physical systems, which integrate computation, networking, and physical processes. The second edition offers two new chapters, several new exercises, and other improvements. The book can be used as a textbook at the advanced undergraduate or introductory graduate level and as a professional reference for practicing engineers and computer scientists. Readers should have some familiarity with machine structures, computer programming, basic discrete mathematics and algorithms, and signals and systems.},

We assume diﬀerent tasks perform functions having diﬀerent criticalities and requiring diﬀerent levels of assurance. We assume a task may have a set of alternative worst-case execution times, each assured to a diﬀerent level of conﬁdence. This paper presents ways to use this information to obtain more precise schedulability analysis and more eﬃcient preemptive ﬁxed priority scheduling. These methods are evaluated using workloads abstracted from production avionics systems.},
